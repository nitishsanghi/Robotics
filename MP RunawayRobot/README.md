# Predator Prey Extended Kalman Filter 

This project is an implementation of an extended kalman filter to a simulated predator prey simulation. The code pipeline is written in python. The prey moves in a non-linear path and the predator using a non-linear estiamtion filter, estimates the prey position and follows the prey. In the gif below the predator in blue in can be seen chasing the prey in green moving along the path in red.
